			<h2> Analysis of CrossFit 2015 Open Scores </h2>

			<h3> Features: </h3>

			<h4> Choose Which Data to Work With </h4>

			You must first go to the <font color="blue">Choose CrossFit Open</font> tab and
		select either the men or the women data to work with. Both files contain the complete set of RX scores.

			<h4> Find Your Percentile Rank </h4>

			A percentile rank tells you how your WOD scores compare to other athletes in the
		data. After choosing a data file to work with, go to the <font color="blue">Get My CrossFit Percentile Rank</font>
		tab. Simply choose an Open WOD from the drop down menu, enter your score, and click "Get My Percentile".
		This will show your worldwide percentile rank and also what your percentile is in each region.

			<h4> Analyze Your Strengths and Weaknesses </h4>
			
			The <font color="blue">My Strengths and Weaknesses</font> tab is intended to be diagnostic and help you
			find areas where you high have performance relative to other athletes and where you may have a weakness.
			First, choose a baseline WOD and enter your score on that WOD. Then, choose a second WOD using the drop down menu.
			The program will find other athletes in the world who scored similar to you on the baseline WOD and show you
			how they typically scored on the second WOD. 
			
			After clicking "Show How I Compare" the program will even show you some athletes in the data
			who are similar to you on the baseline WOD that you chose.

			<h4> Basic Statistics </h4>

			Some athletes may have familiarity with some basic statistical methods. The 
			<font color="blue">Basic Statistics</font> tab allows for you to easily perform
			a linear regression and a correlation to explore relationships between the Open WODs.

			<h4> See How Top Athletes in Different Regions Compare</h4>

			The <font color="blue">Regional Analysis</font> tab allows for you to see how
			the top athletes in different regions are stacking up. The default is set to 20 and
			the program automatically plots the performance of the top 20 athletes in each region.
			These plots then show which regions tend to have the most competitive athletes.
