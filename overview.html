<h4>About</h4>

Harold is a long time CrossFitter (first WOD October 10, 2007) and a professional statistician. Outside of CrossFit, my interests include computational statistics with an emphasis on estimation for large data problems, the impact of measurement error in regression-based models, methods for measuring student achievement, assessment and accountability policy, consequential validity, and psychometrics.
